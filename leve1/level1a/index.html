<p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as the Father of the Nation in India, was a visionary leader who played a crucial role in Indiaâ€™s struggle for independence from British rule. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, he grew up with strong values of truth and morality, which later shaped his philosophy. After studying law in England, he worked in South Africa, where he witnessed racial discrimination and started advocating for civil rights through non-violent resistance. Upon returning to India, he became a key figure in the freedom movement, leading major campaigns like the Non-Cooperation Movement, Civil Disobedience Movement, Salt March (Dandi March), and the Quit India Movement. His principles of Ahimsa (non-violence) and Satyagraha (truth and resistance) became powerful tools against colonial rule, inspiring global movements for peace and justice. Gandhi promoted self-reliance, urging Indians to embrace Khadi and boycott British goods. He also worked for Hindu-Muslim unity, the abolition of untouchability, and the upliftment of marginalized communities. His teachings influenced leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Tragically, he was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy continues to inspire movements for peace, freedom, and equality across the world.</p>
